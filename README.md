# Sorting-visualizer
This Sorting Visualizer is a C++ project that showcases various sorting algorithms using the SDL2 library for visualization. The sorting algorithms implemented include:
Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Bubble Sort,
Merge Sort,
Quick Sort,
Heap Sort
## Features
•	Visualization of sorting algorithms in real-time.  
•	Fixed list size of 130 elements for visualization  
•	Randomization of the list to test different scenarios  
•	Ascending order sorting for all algorithms
## Usage/Examples

Once the program is running, you can use the following controls:

Press 0 to generate a new randomized list.   
Press 1 to start Selection Sort.  
Press 2 to start Insertion Sort.  
Press 3 to start Bubble Sort.  
Press 4 to start Merge Sort.  
Press 5 to start Quick Sort.  
Press 6 to start Heap Sort.  
Press q to exit the Sorting Visualizer.

# Sorting-visualizer
This Sorting Visualizer is a C++ project that showcases various sorting algorithms using the SDL2 library for visualization. The sorting algorithms implemented include:
Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Bubble Sort,
Merge Sort,
Quick Sort,
Heap Sort
## Features

•	Visualization of sorting algorithms in real-time.
•	Fixed list size of 130 elements for visualization
•	Randomization of the list to test different scenarios
•	Ascending order sorting for all algorithms
